				<h2>Welcome, Traveler</h2>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					My name is Russ Rapp — also known as <strong>T3sserak</strong>. I'm
					the founder, developer, and designer behind
					<strong>Mythforge</strong>, a digital space where passion for code,
					creativity, and gaming collides. This project is not just a portfolio;
					it's a living archive of my journey through the world of software
					development and game design.

				<h2>The Programmer's Quest</h2>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					As a self-driven programmer and systems administrator, I'm learning
					the full stack with a primary focus on JavaScript, TypeScript, React,
					and game development tools like ExcaliburJS and Phaser. My goal is to
					become adaptable — a developer who can tackle anything from front-end
					interfaces to game logic, tools, and full app ecosystems.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					Whether I'm building interactive web pages, crafting pixel-art RPGs in
					16-bit style, or experimenting with AI assistants on my home servers,
					I'm constantly pushing to master every angle of programming. I’ve even
					got a growing library of mods, apps, and review blogs in the works —
					all built on passion and purpose.

				<h2>Why Mythforge?</h2>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					The name “Mythforge” represents exactly what I’m trying to create — a
					place where legendary ideas are shaped into functional code. Like a
					forge for heroes and legends, this site is where digital dreams come
					to life, one project at a time.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					From Pokémon-style legion evolutions to custom Elden Ring builds,
					everything I make is rooted in storytelling, learning, and sharing. I
					want to build things that inspire — not just for myself, but for my
					son, my peers, and anyone else chasing their next big idea.

				<h2>What Comes Next</h2>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					My roadmap includes developing educational games for kids, crafting
					modular game mods for Nexus, and writing brutally honest but
					respectful video game reviews. I'm learning, building, and documenting
					everything — not just to get better, but to share that journey with
					others.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					If you're a gamer, a dev, a teacher, a dreamer, or just someone
					curious, I invite you to stick around. You’ll find something new with
					each visit.
