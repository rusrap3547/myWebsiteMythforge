		<p id="app-page-paragraph" class="designbox-flex paragraphs">Apps are a great way to get your ideas out there. They can be used for a variety of purposes. They can be used for entertainment, for business, for education, and for many other things. They can be used on mobile devices, on computers, and on other devices. They can be used by people of all ages, and by people of all backgrounds. They can be used by people all over the world. They can be used by people in all kinds of situations. They can be used by people in all kinds of places for now I'm goint to keep them as a simple display of what I want to do. It all starts with a single algo, a single line of code, a single idea. And then it grows from there. It grows and grows and grows. It grows into something amazing. It grows into something wonderful. It grows into something beautiful. It grows into something that can change the world.</p>

			<p id="simple-escape-paragraph" class="design-flex paragraphs">
				The Simple Escape is a simple game that I created. It is a text-based game that is played in the command line. We follow the protagonist as they find themselves awoken in mysterious circumstances. They must escape the room they are in, and they must do so quickly but not everything is as it seems. </p>
