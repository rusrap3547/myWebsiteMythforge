				<h2>Apps are fun to create. Mobile and otherwise</h2>
				<p class="paragraphwords">
					Apps are a great way to get your ideas out there. They can be used for
					a variety of purposes. They can be used for entertainment, for
					business, for education, and for many other things. They can be used
					on mobile devices, on computers, and on other devices. They can be
					used by people of all ages, and by people of all backgrounds. They can
					be used by people all over the world. They can be used by people in
					all kinds of situations. They can be used by people in all kinds of
					places for now I'm going to keep them as a simple display of what I
					want to do. It all starts with a single algo, a single line of code, a
					single idea. And then it grows from there. It grows and grows and
					grows. It grows into something amazing. It grows into something
					wonderful. It grows into something beautiful. It grows into something
					that can change the world.

					The Simple Escape is a simple game that I created. It is a text-based
					game that is played in the command line. We follow the protagonist as
					they find themselves awoken in mysterious circumstances. They must
					escape the room they are in, and they must do so quickly but not
					everything is as it seems.
