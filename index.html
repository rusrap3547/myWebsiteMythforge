    <h2 id="aboutSection">A little bit more about myself</h2>
    <p id="aboutMesummary">
      If its not obvious enough, I'm going to be using this as a progress on
      everything I do and learn while learning to code. I plan on becoming a
      programmer than can do just about anything and I want to start with web
      development. Growing up I've dabbled in just about everything you can
      think of, but programming is where i had the most fun. Eventually, I'm
      goign to have a showcase of websites that I have created for others. I'm
      going to make a suite of mods that can be added to games and uploaded on
      Nexus. And I'm goign to start a blog of video game reviews, honest ones
      that are only there to provide information, there is already enough people
      that want to destroy good things for no reason. Finally, I'm going to try
      my hand at creating apps and games for both mobile and website. One site
      in particular that I get inspired by is Serebii, I've always wanted to
      make a working Pokedex, might as well start with my coding. If you've read
      this far that means you might actually be interested in what I have to
      say. And for now, all I can say is thank you. I hope you'll stick around
      or come back and check on the progress. It would be my hope that you find
      something different each visit. - T3sserak

    <p id="whatIWant">
      I want to use this website as a display for all my work and my future
      projects. I am not just a web developer and I want to showcase my talent
      for anyone willing to hire me. I am a programmer and I want to be
      adaptable to anything you can ask me for. While in progress, I would hope
      you would support me by simply remove your ad blocker. I am working full
      time and this on the side so I can make some extra. I dont expect you to
      purchase anything from me though. Have a great day!

      <p>
        This is going to be the section where I feature each weeks blog page.
        I'm going to use them as a blog as well as a video game review list.
        Each week I will add a different game to review in the best and most
        honest way I can. So much hard work goes into coding and programming a
        game its not fair to say any game is just outright bad. We can be
        disappointed in games, but that is still an opinion.

      <p id="modExplanation">
        Here at Mythforge, we have always enjoyed the concept of changing what
        we play to add excitement, videogaming is no difference. There have been
        many ways to mod your games in the past but now with companies like
        Nexus and Vortex, we can make our own to publish for everyone to enjoy.
        This will be the attempt at that while still working on our website.

        This section is going to stay empty for the most part for a while, while
        I am still learning react and a few other languages to work on mobile
        apps. I hope that someday soon I will have something here to show along
        with the Goodgle and IOS links for you to download.
