    <p id="aboutMesummary">
     If its not obvious enough, I'm going to be using this as a progress on everything I do and learn while learning to code. I plan on becoming a programmer than can do just about anything and I want to start with web development. Growing up I've dabbled in just about everything you can think of, but programming is where i had the most fun. Eventually, I'm goign to have a showcase of websites that I have created for others. I'm going to make a suite of mods that can be added to games and uploaded on Nexus. And I'm goign to start a blog of video game reviews, honest ones that are only there to provide information, there is already enough people that want to destroy good things for no reason. Finally, I'm going to try my hand at creating apps and games for both mobile and website. One site in particular that I get inspired by is Serebii, I've always wanted to make a working Pokedex, might as well start with my coding. If you've read this far that means you might actually be interested in what I have to say. And for now, all I can say is thank you. I hope you'll stick around or come back and check on the progress. It would be my hope that you find something different each visit. - T3sserak

      I want to use this website as a display for all my work and my future
      projects. I am not just a web developer and I want to showcase my talent
      for anyone willing to hire me. I am a programmer and I want to be adaptable to anything you can ask me for.
