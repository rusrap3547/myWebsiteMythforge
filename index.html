			<p id="aboutMesummary" class="paragraphwords">
				If its not obvious enough, I'm going to be using this as a progress on
				everything I do and learn while learning to code. I plan on becoming a
				programmer than can do just about anything and I want to start with web
				development. Growing up I've dabbled in just about everything you can
				think of, but programming is where i had the most fun. Eventually, I'm
				goign to have a showcase of websites that I have created for others. I'm
				going to make a suite of mods that can be added to games and uploaded on
				Nexus. And I'm goign to start a blog of video game reviews, honest ones
				that are only there to provide information, there is already enough
				people that want to destroy good things for no reason. Finally, I'm
				going to try my hand at creating apps and games for both mobile and
				website. One site in particular that I get inspired by is Serebii, I've
				always wanted to make a working Pokedex, might as well start with my
				coding. If you've read this far that means you might actually be
				interested in what I have to say. And for now, all I can say is thank
				you. I hope you'll stick around or come back and check on the progress.
				It would be my hope that you find something different each visit. -

				I want to use this website as a display for all my work and my future
				projects. I am not just a web developer and I want to showcase my talent
				for anyone willing to hire me. I am a programmer and I want to be
				adaptable to anything you can ask me for. While in progress, I would
				hope you would support me by simply remove your ad blocker. I am working
				full time and this on the side so I can make some extra. I dont expect
				you to purchase anything from me though. Have a great day!

					This is going to be the section where I feature each weeks blog page.
					I'm going to use them as a blog as well as a video game review list.
					Each week I will add a different game to review in the best and most
					honest way I can. So much hard work goes into coding and programming a
					game its not fair to say any game is just outright bad. We can be
					disappointed in games, but that is still an opinion.

					Here at Mythforge, we have always enjoyed the concept of changing what

					been many ways to mod your games in the past but now with companies
					like Nexus and Vortex, we can make our own to publish for everyone to
					enjoy. This will be the attempt at that while still working on our
					website.
